# VAJRA – Personal Desktop AI Assistant

## Product Vision
VAJRA is a desktop-based, always-available personal AI assistant that responds to voice commands, helps in daily life decisions, controls the system, and feels like a premium, human-like assistant.

VAJRA is designed to act as a personal AI companion on the desktop that is always available without the need to manually open an application. It listens for a wake word, understands voice or typed commands, and performs tasks ranging from system control to internet-based queries. VAJRA also assists in everyday decisions such as food suggestions, routine planning, and basic guidance based on the user’s situation. The goal of VAJRA is to provide a smooth, intelligent, and human-like assistant experience with a premium interface.

### Emotional Goal
VAJRA should feel calm, reliable, and intuitive to interact with, making the user feel assisted rather than overwhelmed. Interactions with VAJRA should reduce effort in daily tasks and decisions, while maintaining a sense of control and trust. The assistant should feel responsive, respectful, and premium, creating a smooth and stress-free experience.

## Problem Statement

### Problem 1: Daily friction in desktop usage
Desktop users often need to perform repetitive tasks such as opening applications, searching for information, adjusting system settings, or sending quick messages. These actions require multiple manual steps, switching between apps, and constant attention, which interrupts focus and wastes time. Existing tools either require explicit interaction or feel fragmented, making simple tasks more effortful than they should be.

### Problem 2: Voice assistants are not built for desktop workflows
Most existing voice assistants are primarily designed for mobile devices or smart home environments and do not integrate deeply with desktop workflows. On desktop systems, voice interaction often feels limited, inconsistent, or secondary to manual input. As a result, users are unable to rely on voice-based assistance for continuous desktop usage, reducing the potential of hands-free and natural interaction.

### Problem 3: Lack of personalization in daily assistance
Current desktop tools and assistants largely provide generic responses without considering the user’s daily context, preferences, or situation. This lack of personalization makes interactions feel robotic and disconnected from real-life needs. As a result, users are required to make additional decisions and adjustments themselves, reducing the effectiveness of assistance in everyday situations.

## Target User

### Primary Target User
The primary target user of VAJRA is a desktop or laptop user who regularly uses their system for work, study, or personal tasks and values efficiency, convenience, and automation. This user prefers voice-based interaction to reduce manual effort and seeks a more natural and intelligent way to interact with their computer. They are comfortable with technology but want tools that feel intuitive rather than complex.

### Secondary Target User
The secondary target user of VAJRA includes students, creators, and professionals who spend long hours on their desktops and frequently multitask between applications. These users benefit from hands-free interaction, quick system control, and contextual assistance while focusing on their primary work. They value tools that save time and reduce interruptions without requiring constant manual input.

## Core Features

### Core Feature 1: Always-available voice activation
VAJRA should be always available in the background and activated using a voice-based wake word without requiring the user to manually open the application. This allows seamless, hands-free interaction and makes the assistant feel naturally integrated into the desktop environment rather than behaving like a traditional app.

### Core Feature 2: Natural voice and text interaction
VAJRA should support both natural voice commands and typed input through a floating interface, allowing users to interact in the way that feels most comfortable at any moment. Spoken commands should be accurately transcribed into text and executed, providing transparency and control. This dual interaction model ensures flexibility, accessibility, and a smooth assistant experience across different usage scenarios.

### Core Feature 3: Desktop and application control
VAJRA should be capable of controlling core desktop functions and commonly used applications through voice or text commands. This includes tasks such as opening and closing applications, managing system actions, and performing simple automated workflows. The goal is to allow users to interact with their computer in a more natural and efficient way without relying solely on manual input.

### Core Feature 4: Daily Life Intelligence
VAJRA should provide intelligent assistance for everyday decisions by considering basic context such as time, usage patterns, and user preferences. Instead of offering generic responses, the assistant should suggest practical and situation-aware guidance for daily activities like routine planning and simple decision-making. This allows VAJRA to feel more personal, supportive, and human-like in daily use.
